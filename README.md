# Intel Image Classification
Link to Kaggle (dataset): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification

In this notebook, I will try to do the following:

  1. Load the data, visualize and preprocess it
  2. Use pre trained models for image classification (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152, InceptionResNet)
